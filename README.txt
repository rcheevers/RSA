# RSA
implementing RSA encryption algorithm
To-Do:
fix json file stuff again
write my own pow function
    chinese remainder theorem
    square and multiply algorithm
add padding scheme
add method to convert messages into numbers automatically
protect against some common attacks against badly implimented RSA
    Fermat factorization and Wiener's Attack
    padding should protect against Coppersmith's Attack
    see if I can find any others
implement the rest of the signal protocol
    Diffie-Hellman
    Eliptical curve
    Advanced Encryption Standard
    Secure Hash Algorithm
